# Development Log
> A successful final project is built slowly over many weeks not thrown together at the last minute. To incentivize good project pacing and to let your project mentor stay informed about the status of your work, each week you should add an entry to your log.md file in the development directory.

> Each entry should describe:

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

> The development log will be graded for completion, detail, and honesty â€“ not progress. It is much better to truthfully evaluate the work you completed in a week then lie to make the project sound further along then it really is. It is totally acceptable to have an entry that says you tried nothing and accomplished nothing. However if every week starts to say that, both yourself and your project mentor will be able to identify the issue before it becomes impossible to fix.

[Example of Good/Bad Changelist descriptions](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/cl-descriptions.html)

## Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)
Nothing

## Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)
Nothing

## Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)
Nothing

## Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)
Looked for resources and spent my time learning about the python tqdm library, some of python's tensorflow use cases, and learning how to work with midi files. Most of the time was spent also on finding the best model to be trained such as Random Forest, the Naive Bayes, and the Restricted Boltzmann (which i ended up using). Enjoyed this process but it was probably the toughest because finding reliable and updated resources is quite rare and takes a lot of time.

## Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)
Started on the coding process and figured out how midi files can be manipulated. A lot of time was spent on watching YouTube videos on how midi file manipulation works, how neural networks can be implemented and selecting the different methods of voting (eventually decided on a physics based model)

## Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)
Coding the first few files 

## Sep Holiday (5 Sep - 10 Sep) **Submission date is 10 Sep**
Fixing errors and improving the code
