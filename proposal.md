# General description of project
> I have 3 ideas but I am not sure which one is better 
> Idea #1: A program that charts a family tree upon input on relationship between people
> Idea #2: A machine learning algorithm that generates music by itself 
> Idea #3: A student-teacher booking system which allows students to schedule time with their teachers

#Goals of project
> Goal #1: Allows the user to chart their family tree from text to visuals with the person's name and date of lifespan 
> Goal #2: Lets AI (with the help of neural networks) generate cool sounds by itself for people without music knowledge to enjoy 
> Goal #3: Allows a student to book timeslots with the teacher through a portal or online

# Listing of features
> 1#: Family tree is able to show the birthdate, deathdate, relations amongst people, and gender 
> 2#: People can run the neural network model such that it generates a MIDI sequence given an input sequence of MIDI ragtime songs.
> 3#: Allows teachers to display their name, free time slots, and subjects while students can book them (simplified version of youcanbook.me)

> Using neural networks unlike the genetic algrothim and sounds not limited to guitar sounds; generating MIDI sequences instead of using an internal system to produce sound


> #3: https://github.com/sravan510/Patient---Doctor-Scheduler/blob/master/Patient%20or%20Doctor%20Scheduler.py
> Adapted to teachers and without the use of a list or dictionary; real-time; web application
> 
# Listing of Key Use Cases
> Add in a text file whenever people want to graph their ancestoral chart especially if it is too long to visulaize
> When composing music, musicians can try out new and unique compositions to help make a song
> Whenever necessary, students can book teachers for timeslots if they have any queries

# Skills that my project requires me to pick up
> 1: Python graphing and plotting; making use of txt files and reading them; converting an diagram to a png
> 2: Learning machine learning and implementing neural networks; learning about how to handle MIDI sequences; using tensorflow and numpy
> 3: Django, Flask to build web page, handling python realtime
